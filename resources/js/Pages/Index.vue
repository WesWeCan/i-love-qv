                    QV is a clever method for figuring out which issues people care about most. For instance, if the group must decide on how to spend their time on different tasks, QV can gather and organise preferences about which tasks the group wants to prioritise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everyone has equal voting power, which you can use to boost the issues you care about mostâ€“ but you must weigh your decisions carefully. If you go all out on one issue it will cost you more (this is the quadratic formula) and you will have less voting power for the remaining issues on the ballot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once all ballots are submitted the collective results are tallied. QV can significantly mitigate the â€˜tyranny of the majorityâ€™. In other words, situations in which a factional majority can suppress the will of the minority. In this way, it leads to more equitable and just decision making.
