                <h2>About QV</h2>
            </div>
                <p>QV is a clever method for figuring out which issues people care about most. For instance, if the group must decide on how to spend their time on different tasks, QV can gather and organise preferences about which tasks the group wants to prioritise.</p>

                <p>Everyone has equal voting power, which you can use to boost the issues you care about mostâ€“ but you must weigh your decisions carefully. If you go all out on one issue it will cost you more (this is the quadratic formula) and you will have less voting power for the remaining issues on the ballot.</p>

                <p>Once all ballots are submitted the collective results are tallied. QV can significantly mitigate the 'tyranny of the majority'. In other words, situations in which a factional majority can suppress the will of the minority. In this way, it leads to more equitable and just decision making.</p>

                <h2>Our tool</h2>
            </div>
               
                <p>Each ballot can contain up to ten issues, which can each be voted on. It is up to you weigh these issues and decide which ones you care about most. Instead of simply voting for or against an issue, you express the degree to which you are for or against an issue by tapping the plus and minus buttons. You can also choose not to vote in either direction on an issue, thus abstaining.</p>
                <p>The heart is a reservoir for your voting power, and as you vote power will move between the heart and the issues you're voting on. You can reset the heart if you'd like to start voting from scratch again.</p>
                <p>Once you're finished press submit and your votes will be tallied with those of the group, and the collective result shared.</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
            </div>
                <p>Firstly, a ranking of all issues based on most netto votes. But results can also point to remarkable outcomes. For instance, issues that received a lot of traffic <span class="icon"><img :src="traffic" alt="Traffic" class="traffic-icon" /></span> may be polarising <span class="icon"><img :src="collision" alt="Collision" class="collision-icon" /></span>or issues nobody in the group is against (a so-called no-brainer.) <span class="icon"><img :src="brain" alt="Brain" class="brain-icon" /></span></p>

                <p>These outcomes are badged, which can be helpful for guiding further deliberation and discussion. It is up to the group if a QV vote is binding or a stepping stone in your decision making process.</p>
